Bathroom Wall Controller
- use in 3 full bathrooms (half bath doesn't have fan)

Humidity Controller
- Monitor humidity in bathroom.  If humidity is above a setpoint turn on fan.  Otherwise turn fan off.

Light Controller
- Ideally use wifi controller LED lights.  Bulbs are between $20-$30 each.
- Is it possible to dim the bulbs at the switch side (create a dimmer)
- install LEDs behind mirror.  This could allow for night light feature.
- lights turn on via motion sensor.  if it is night time (after sunset) the lights come on very dim (10%)

To make things really cool
- voice controller
- speakers to play sound
